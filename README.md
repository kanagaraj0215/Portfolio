# Data Science Portfolio
Welcome to my data science portfolio! Here, you will find a collection of projects demonstrating my skills and expertise in various areas of data science, including machine learning, natural language processing, time series analysis, and more.

## About Me
I am a passionate data scientist with a strong programming and data analysis background. I am deeply enthusiastic about transforming data into actionable insights and building predictive models to solve real-world problems.

## Projects

### **[Airbnb Pricing Assistant](https://github.com/kanagaraj0215/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/supervised-machine-learning/airbnb-pricing-assistant)**

The Airbnb pricing assistance project, a data-driven application of machine learning in the sharing economy, leverages Linear Regression, ridge regression, and KNeighborsRegressor to predict optimal listing prices based on features such as location, property type, and amenities. By cleaning and preparing historical data from Airbnb listings, I developed and compared these models to determine the best approach for accurate price predictions. Linear regressor performed better among all these models for the given datasets. This project highlights the practical application of machine learning, offering data-driven strategies to maximize occupancy and revenue for Airbnb hosts.



### **[Creditcard Fraud Detection](https://github.com/kanagaraj0215/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/supervised-machine-learning/creditcard-fraud-detection)**

The Credit Card Fraud Detection project utilizes Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest, and XGBClassifier to identify fraudulent transactions. I developed and compared these models to achieve exceptionally high accuracy in detecting fraud. The ensemble methods, particularly Random Forest and XGBClassifier, showed superior performance in capturing complex patterns and reducing false positives. This project demonstrates the application of advanced machine learning techniques to enhance security and minimize financial losses due to fraudulent activities, providing a reassuring level of protection.

### **[Housing Price Estimator](https://github.com/kanagaraj0215/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/supervised-machine-learning/housing-price-estimator)**

The Housing Price Estimator project employs decision Tree algorithms to predict housing prices, exploring the model's performance with and without the chi-squared feature selection method. By preprocessing the housing dataset and incorporating significant features such as size and amenities, I developed models to estimate property values. The comparison revealed that the algorithm performed well without the dataset's chi-squared feature selection. This project underscores the value of feature selection in refining model performance for real estate price estimation.

### **[ALS Patient Clustering](https://github.com/kanagaraj0215/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/unsupervised-learning/als-patient-clustering)**

The objective of this project is to analyze the 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users and predict which previously purchased item will be in user's next order. Customer segmentation and affinity analysis are also done to study user purchase patterns.
