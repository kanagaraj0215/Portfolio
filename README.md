# Data Science Portfolio
Welcome to my data science portfolio! Here, you will find a collection of projects demonstrating my skills and expertise in various areas of data science, including machine learning, natural language processing, time series analysis, and more.

# About Me
I am a passionate data scientist with a strong programming and data analysis background. I am deeply enthusiastic about transforming data into actionable insights and building predictive models to solve real-world problems.

In this project I have used survival analysis to study how the likelihood of the customer churn changes over time. I have also implementd a Random Forest model to predict the customer churn and deployed a model using flask webapp on Heroku. [App](https://churn-prediction-app.herokuapp.com/)

The objective of this project is to analyze the 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users and predict which previously purchased item will be in user's next order. Customer segmentation and affinity analysis are also done to study user purchase patterns.
